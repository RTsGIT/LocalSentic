# Sentic-Parse
For SenticNet 3 analysis with semantic parser

The downloadtagger.py file downloads stanford POS tagger implementation, you can download latest version as well, although it supportss only JDK 8 version. I have already downloaded one version of this for you, which uses jDK 7 version.

MainSentinet.py is the main file to be run directly, then enter the sentence or review to be run in the console.
It should return the bag-of-concepts, with their polarity.
